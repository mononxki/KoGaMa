# KoGaMa Repository Closure

I am saddened to state that I will halt all of my development projects for KoGaMa.

I had a blast of a time through all those 10 years of my journey with this game but some things need to end.

I have hurt a lot of people and it genuinely weights me down emotionally and makes taking a single look at KoGaMa very painful.

Utilify Update 3.0.2 (New emojis) is my last **public** commit towards kogama.

Any other works that you might eventually find under my name are either fake unless they come strictly from me or my friends.

I will stop showing up on KoGaMa for the sake of my mental health and wellbeing but I still will try to be of help to my friends in times of their need.

Farewell, Kaiser.
